This study collected an unpaired underexposed surveillance image dataset Unpaired Underexposed Monitoring Images, UUMImages, which mainly consists of 81 underexposed video screenshot images taken from mobile phones. To ensure that the underexposed image dataset includes images with varying degrees of underexposure, 32 images were obtained from the public low-light image dataset LOL, and 14 images were selected from the backlit image dataset BacklitImages to expand this dataset. This dataset covers underexposed images of different degrees and environments, totaling 127 test images.
